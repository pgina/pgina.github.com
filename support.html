  <h4><span>The pGina Community</span></h4>
  <div class="contentarea">
    <p>
    pGina developers and users alike count on each other to provide
    a community for the continued support and future of pGina.  There
    are several ways to get involved, ask questions, report problems, 
    or otherwise hang out with others.  In all cases, these resources
    are to be used second to the available <a href="docs/">documentation</a>.
    </p>

  <h5><span>Mailing Lists</span></h5>
  <div class="contentarea">

    Hosted by google, we have two mailing lists:

    <ul>

      The end-user and general discussion group.

      (<a href="mailto:pgina-devel@googlegroups.com">pgina-devel@googlegroups.com</a>) --
      The development group for discussion on all things developer related (pGina, GINA,
      Credential Providers, pGina Plugins, etc).
      <p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pgina-devel/subscribe">Subscribe</a>,
      <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pgina-devel">Archives</a>.</p>
   </ul>
  </div>

  <h5><span>Reporting Bugs, Requesting Features</span></h5>
  <div class="contentarea">
  <p>
  You can of course bring up feature ideas and bugs you may find on the mailing lists, IRC, etc.  However,
  we formally track work via the "Issues" feature on Github.  You can use this interface to file and track
  issues here: <a href="https://github.com/pgina/pgina/issues">https://github.com/pgina/pgina/issues</a>
  </p>
  </div>

  <h5><span>IRC - #pgina</span></h5>
  <div class="contentarea">
  <p>
  You can also find a few intrepid and diehard users, and the occassional developer, in the #pgina room
  via IRC on the freenode (irc.freenode.net) network.  Join us!  Most of us lurk, and time-zones vary, so
  you may need to hangout a bit.
