<p>
After several months of hard work, the pGina team is wrapping up a ground-up rewrite 
and reworking of the pGina solution.  This is the first major overhaul of the pGina
codebase in over 10 years.  The culmination of this work is what we are proud
to introduce as Version 3.0.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We need your help!</strong>  <a href="download.html">Download</a> a copy of the
3.0 BETA build today and
let us know how it works for you.  The more we receive feedback from you, the end user (positive and negative!),
the better.  We need your help to test this version on the various flavors of Windows and 
versions of backends that we simply cant test during development.
</p>
<p>Here are the highlights of version 3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>95% of core functionality implemented in Managed C# (.Net 4.0)</li>
  <li>100% managed code Plugin API</li>

  <li>Supports all Windows plaftorms, from XP SP3 through Windows 8 Developer Preview, x86 and x64 - all from a single installer</li>

</ul>
