    The pGina plugin API allows for any number of plugins written in managed code 
    to be loaded and used.  Read our <a href="docs/">documentation</a> and join the
    <a href="support.html">mailing lists</a> or IRC to ask questions and get help in
    creating your own plugin, or making changes to pGina itself.  
    You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/pgina/pgina/tree/master/Plugins">
    out of box</a> plugin source code, and pGina code as reference.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you have developed a plugin, and would like it included out of the box, you must
    license it under the same license as pGina, and you must get your plugin source included
    in the pGina tree.  Emailing the developer list is the best way to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you have developed a plugin, and would like us to link to it so that others
    can find and use it, email <a href="mailto:nate@pgina.org">nate@pgina.org</a> with a 
    link and short description today.

    <p>
    While pGina is not the only implementation of a custom GINA and Credential Provider available,
    it is one of the few that is open source, and backed by over 10 years of developer
    experience.  Discussion of related topics are welcome on the pgina-devel <a href="support.html">
    mailing list</a>.
