            <p>pGina is a pluggable, open source credential provider (and GINA)
              replacement.  It allows for alternate methods of interactive user
              authentication and access management on machines running the Windows
              operating system.</p>

          <h2>Windows Authentication without Active Directory</h2>
          <p>pGina is a flexible replacement for the default Windows credential
          provider (or GINA on XP and earlier systems).  With pGina, you can
          integrate Windows clients into existing, heterogeneous identity managment systems.
          With pGina, you can support Windows clients with a
          single OpenLDAP database or other identity storage backend, without
          the overhead of a full Active Directory installation.</p>

          <h2>Plugin Architecture</h2>
          <p>With plugins, you can support authentication and authorization of
            Windows users using the backend of
            your choice. Plugins are written in managed code and allow for user
            authentication, authorization and session management. End result is
            that you, the admin, can choose how your users are authenticated,
            authorized and managed. Already have users in LDAP? Want to manage
            your users with a MySQL database? Using a custom backend and want
            to craft your own authentication code? pGina is the solution.</p>

      <h2>Plugins</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>pGina comes with a lot of plugins out of the box (MySQL, LDAP, Logging, Single User, ...).
      All of the built-in plugins are documented in our <a href="https://github.com/pgina/pgina/wiki">documentation</a> pages.
      However, the whole point of having a plugin model is so that you, the end user, can choose the
      method and style of user authentication, authorization and management that you wish to use.</p>
