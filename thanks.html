  Our most sincere thanks goes to the current, past, and future users of pGina.  It is your need, feedback,
  and support that allows this community to exist.

  Additionally, our thanks to Dr. David Wolff. Dr. Wolff jumped on board with the 3.0 re-write and has
  contributed immeasurably to it's implementation.  He wrote the LDAP plugin, the MySQL plugins, the 
  Session Limit plugin, contributed documentation, fixed bugs and added features to pGina core, the 
  Plugin API and just about every other facet of the project.  Thank you!

  Steve Cross deserves more than just a nod, as he single-handedly kept the 2.x branch moving forward
  for several years after the primary developer took an extended hiatus.  It was this determination to
  keep the project going that eventually helped convince the original developer to again re-focus on the
  project.
