    Additionally, our thanks to David Wolff.  David jumped on board with the 3.0 re-write and has
    contributed immeasurably to it's implementation.  He wrote the LDAP plugin, the MySQL plugins, the
    Session Limit plugin, contributed documentation, fixed bugs and added features to pGina core, the
    Plugin API and just about every other facet of the project.  Thank you!

    Steve Cross deserves more than just a nod, as he single-handedly kept the 2.x branch moving forward
    for several years after the primary developer took an extended hiatus.  It was this determination to
    keep the project going that eventually helped convince the original developer to again re-focus on the
    project.
